1. Disaster strikes at the Hyatt Regency Kansas City Hotel
1. At the time of the disaster, around 1,600 people were gathered for a tea dance. At around 7 p.m., the second-level walkway had about 40 spectators. The third and fourth-level walkways held about 16 and 20 people each.
1. But what caused the Hyatt Regency walkway to collapse?
1. During construction, an apparent design flaw was identified. The original plan called for six steel hanger rods to run directly from the second-floor walkway to the ceiling for support. However, the steel manufacturing contractor objected to this design, as it required rods to be screw-threaded to hold the fourth-floor walkway in place.
1. The contractor identified this as a potential hazard and proposed a new plan: a set of tie rods that connected the fourth-floor walkway to the ceiling and a separate set that connected the second-floor walkway to the fourth-floor walkway.
1. The plan was ultimately used for construction, meaning the second-floor walkway support was connected to the fourth-floor walkway. This meant that the upper hanger rods of the fourth-floor walkway took on undue strain, as they had to hold double the load initially intended.  The design change, though seemingly subtle, was enough to undermine the safety of the structures critically.
