"Roadways, passages & underpasses",2014006,"Main road Lakkar Mandi, Doraha","Problems related to this are basically after construction which are faced by the nearby locality which involves the issue of water logging which is basically the major concern of  each road in India.
 Reason of this issue is basically the improper quality control at the site and improper level of roads leading to improper drainage and one main issue is that existing site engineers do not opt for the upcoming modern construction techniques which are like pervious members to remove excess of water.
Drainage issue generally arise due to improper drainage layout or the improper laying of drainage pipe lines, in case of rainfall these are generally provided with pumps to remove excess of rainfall water fitted in sewage system in locality but due to inefficiency of these pumps or lower output ratings to reduce inventory cost it couldn’t completely remove this excess of water thus leading to water logging in such areas. Consequences of this problem is that it lead to cause health issues and cause viral infection due to unhygienic issues, due to stagnant water mosquito breeding also occurs which lead to cause health issues.
One more problem with this construction is wearing and tearing of the top most surface of the roads which lead to degrade aesthetic appearance of the roads as well as also lead to accidents due to improper surface smoothness. 
So basically these are the issues which are faced due to the improper road construction and passages. 
In between construction phase problem related to disputes among the locality people also occur which lead to chaos and verbal fights among them, in which they basically demand about construction around there shelter in the way they want which lead to chaos among the contractor, labourers and the people nearby which also a problem which is basically related to noise and headache to nearby locality people."

Road passage for traveling,2014041,Underpass,"See there are number of underpass constructed in the field of civil engineering, and it's give number of benefits to the society but there is a major cause that every underpass have is that, there is problem of drainage . The problem of drainage is such a big cause in the construction of underpass which makes traveling uncomfortable mostly during rainy season. The engineers try to give  number of remidies to overcome the problem of drainage but still we all see the problem of drainage in the underpass. So there is need to overcome the problem of drainage. "
Construction of building and houses ,2014041,House and building,"See there is big problem of regularly removal of the vegetation and plantation, trees, from the land where the building is constructing to make the land fit for  construction. This problem reduces the environmental resources in the surrounding. So that there is need to make some solutions in such a way that there is less removal of plantation and the building construction become efficient. "

Residential building ,2014051,Residential ,Dampness
Building ,2014080,Residental building ,"●Problem:-Removal of paint on building or blister in paint on building
●Causes:- 1)sometimes mositure trapped beneath the paints
2)there are leaks issues.
3)surface on which paints is done ,not properly prepared or cleaned that surface before doing the paint, also leads to removal of paint.
4)sometimes walls of building directly exposed with high temperature(Sun light) or high humidity (because of rain).
5)if there is humid condition, we apply too thick paint,it leads to dry the outer layer faster as compared to inner layer ,this is also leading to blistering 
●Prevention:-1)Properly prepared the surface before doing the painting. 
2)Use high quality materials for paints
3)Also avoid painting in unfavorable condition (in heavy raining conditions)
4)Never apply the new paint layer on effected layer(on which blistering occurs),need to find the cause root of that problem 
5)we also apply layer of oil or grease,which prevent entering of water comes from outside."

Building ,2014127,House,"Dampness:-

Causes-
1. Presence of water in the wall due to leakage of pipe.
2. Not proper ventilation of the building.
3. Water dampness causes growth of bacteria in the wall which causes health issue to the person who are live there.

Preventive Measures-
1. Leakage of bike should not be there.
2. Proper ventilation should be there so that dampness will get dry by air.
3. Good quality paint should be applied.
4. Waterproof quote should be applied on the terrace show that water will not reach to the wall.
"
Residential ,2014127,Building ,"Crack:-
Causes-
1. If provision of sufficient clear covered is not a provided in any structural members like beam than tensioning in lower zone will cause cracks.
2. If described is wider than 0.3 mm then it will covers rusting of bars.
3. In case of water tank acceptable crack limit is only 0.1 mm.
4. If sufficient amount of water is not provided during mixing of concreting and proper curing is not done then also crack develops.
5. Wall exposed to frequently changing temperature then heat and cold will cause cracks.

Preventive Measures-
1. Provide sufficient clear cover that is the minimum clear cover required for beam, slab etc to prevent cracks.
2. If crack initiate then we should do grouting of that parts so that crack will not increase its length.
3. While construction process make sure that we are providing sufficient amount of water as per the water ratio in the concrete mix.
4. After the casting of the structure members we should cure it properly so that crack will not develop like shrinkage crack etc

,,,"Being a civil engineer comes with overwhelming responsibilities from the beginning of a project to very end. From the idea to its concrete form, a civil engineer plays a crucial role. 

The most major problem that I’ve observed isn’t a technical one, rather it’s a fundamental problem. We often think role of civil engineer is limited to just the design and analysis of structure. However, it is a prime duty of a civil engineer to do the required due diligence  even through the construction process. I have came across various scenarios where a civil engineer hand overs the design to contractors and gets rid of the responsibility which ultimately leads to defects due to improper workmanship and supervision.

Some of the technical problems that I have observed as far as civil engineering is concerned are as follows:-

Creation/Structure type - Problem

 1. Pavement- Improper curing in case of rigid pavements (concrete) leading to improper finish of top surface.
2. Pre-Engineered buildings - Excess tolerance parameters are considered. 
3. Industrial sheds - Lack of integrity between supporting walls and steel structure.
4. Slabs - Over-finishing and related concerns.
5. RCC structures - Cracks 
6. Residential buildings - Seepage (Even in new structures).
7. Heavy structures - Improper soil analysis leading to settlement of structure.
8. Underpasses and roads - Improper drainage, leading to clogging or roads.
9. Institutions- Insufficient airflow leading to overheating of structure.
10. Transportation hubs (especially bus stands) - Proper planning is not done leading to traffic congestion and accidents.
11. Over-reinforced structures - Sudden failures leading to fatal accidents.

"
,,,"1) RCC Structures - (hospitals, residential buildings, malls, bridges etc) 
Common problems during construction of RCC structures - 
Lap differences in steel of columns. (due to mistake in reading drawings or poor workmanship) 
Wastage of steel 
wrong spacing between bars
Not Curing properly on site
improper concrete mix (for on site concrete plants)
Not using measures to remove rusting of steel on site. 

Due to these problems during construction, Desired strength of a building cannot be achieved, which further leads to generation of cracks, dampness, and corrosion/rusting of steel members due to its exposure to outer environment. 
So, these problems may cause failure of structure member.

However, Type of soil and its bearing capacity also plays very important role in stability of a structure."

2. Improper curing of bricks,
3. Dampness in the wall,
4. Honeycombing in building slab,

7. Long cracks that run across the wall
8. Improper soil analysis
9. Diagonal cracks that appear on the corners of window frames or door frames
10. Use of defective materials
11. Steel- Corrosion of steel reinforcement
12. Poor construction work

The patch work is very irregular.
There is no proper way for filling the pits or maintenance  of roads.
The level of patch work from the road is always high.
There is no proper compaction of subsoil and and other materials.
There is no proper bonding between the old and new material.
